# Asp.Net_MVC_Crud_Operations
Crud operations using ASP.net core MVC  
In this project, I learned n-tier architecture, generic repos, unit of work.

1- Data Access Layer which deals with the context:     
  -Data: Models and Context  
  -Repositories: Which access context and perform operations.  
  -UnitOfWork  
2- Business Layers: It Has Managers which deals with the DAL  
3- Presentation Layer: Which is responsible for views and controllers
